                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                In the world of skincare, figuring out where to start can be extremely overwhelming. With thousands of products in the market and a bunch of different brands, it can be difficult to decide what products are best for you. When I first started getting into skincare at the prime age of 13, my go-to was the skin section at Target. I just believed whatever the bottles said. Oh, this product is going to clear my acne—sold. This product is going to remove all of my blackheads—sold. When a product didn’t work, I went back for another brand that said the exact same thing. At the end of it all, my skin actually ended up worse. That’s when I took my money to more expensive brands that also claimed that their products would fix my skin. Did it work? Yes, but not without changing my skin with all its chemicals. I started doing more research on skincare: the do’s and don’ts, the different types, natural ingredients versus chemical ingredients, etc.. If I had known what I know now when I was 13-years-old, my skin would be in a much better place. 
             
                </p>
                <p>

                To prevent people from making the same mistakes that I did, I wanted to create a very general guide to starting a skincare journey. Skincare is complex as heck, and there is so much depth to it that I will not be able to cover in this website. Please remember these are only the baby steps to starting your skincare routine, and that creating a routine that is truly unique to your skin requires much more intensive research and time. There are 4 main steps that I will be focusing on: getting to know your skin, researching ingredients, establishing a routine, and finally, the waiting game. Let’s get started! 

                

            </div>
        </div>  
      
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <div class="row justify-content-center mb-5">
            <div class="col-18 col-md-12">
                <h3>Step 1: Get to know your skin</h3>
                <p>There are five basic skin types: normal, oily, combination, dry, and sensitive. However, it’s important to remember that everyone has different skin. You could be slightly oily, but not very oily. Now, here's where it gets more complicated. There’s a spectrum for each type, and that’s where you really have to dive deeper. Skin concerns are a crucial aspect of skin types that cannot be ignored when choosing your products. People with oily skin usually deal with clogged pores, whereas people with dry skin deal with flakiness. In order to decide what products are best for you, you need to know what concerns you wish to target. Getting to know your skin early on can make the trial and error process  (we'll get to that later) much less chaotic. There are many methods of figuring out your skin type out on the internet. I personally love Paula's Choice's blog about it!

        <div class="row justify-content-center mb-5">
            <div class="col-18 col-md-12">
                <h4>Step 2: Research ingredients</h4>
                <p>When you look at the ingredients in your products, do you actually understand what they are and what they do? I know I didn’t; however, knowing what each ingredient does is super important. There are so many different ingredients out there. When you get to know what each ingredient does, you have a better understanding of what ingredients are good for your skin, and what ingredients you should stay away from. For example, if you have dry skin, you don’t want to use products with alcohol in it because it will strip away your moisture. If you have sensitive skin, you want to stay away from products that contain large amounts of fragrance because it will likely irritate your skin. Different ingredients have different purposes. Knowing what ingredients are good for your skin type and concerns will help you decide what products will truly be good for your skin. Below is a graphic that provides some well-known tips on the more complicated skin types. I left out normal skin tips because those skin types are usually more straightforward.</p>

        <div class="row justify-content-center mb-5">
            <div class="col-18 col-md-12">
                <h5>Step 3: Establish a routine</h5>
                <p>While some skin-types can get away with simply using cleanser and moisturizer, others typically require more steps. The most basic routine is cleansing, treatment, and then moisturizer, but there's also many other types of products like essence, serum, eye cream, sleeping masks, etc.. The amount of steps you incorporate into your routine is completely up to you and your skin needs. Confusing, I know. Because  you're just starting off, it might be helpful to stick with the most basic routine and then see what else your skin needs as time progresses. A very popular skincare saying is, "Skincare isn't a destination, it's a journey". To provide some examples, I reached out to some friends with various skin types to show you how different everyone's routine can be. They also talk about some of their favorite products and how they have helped their skin, so you might want to check those out if you have the same skin type! Don't forget to watch the videos in 1080p :)   </p>

                <h6>Step 4: Wait for results</h6>
                <p>This is probably the most daunting aspect of starting your skincare journey. We naturally want to see results within a week or so, but the truth is that sometimes, results can take a month or more to show. This process can be really confusing. For example, within a few days, you might see little red pimples popping up on your skin, freak out, and then throw away your products because you're convinced that it doesn't work anymore. However, that might just be a sign that it's working. This process is called purging, which can take about 4-6 weeks. If you're still breaking out after that, it might be a sign that the products you chose aren't for your skin. If the product is giing you rashes, blisters, bad itches and burning, then you might be allergic to the product and need to stop using it. To prevent that, make sure you test the product on a little patch of skin beforehand.

                <h7>Conclusion</h7>
                <p>If you couldn't tell yet, skincare is super duper complex. There are so many things to pay attention to and so much research that needs to be done, which is why it can seem like a pretty overwhelming path to go down. And, this is only the beginning. If I were to include all the details and ingredients and types of products, this website would be extremely long. I also don't have the skills to create that type of website yet, but who knows, maybe in the future! I hope this gave you a better idea of how to begin your skincare journey, and if not, don't worry, there's so many resources out there on the internet. You just got to do the work and research! To mention some resources, SkinCarisma, CosDNA, and Beautypedia are super helpful websites that make it easier for you to discover the best products for your skin and to learn more about the ingredients in specific products. Lastly, special thank you to Julie Madsen, Sandra Mendoza, Grencewincel Garing, Kelly He, Leilani Le, and Trinity Chung for sending me their lovely routines.   </p>
